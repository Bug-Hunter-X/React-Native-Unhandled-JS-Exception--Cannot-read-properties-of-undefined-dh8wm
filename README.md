# React Native Unhandled JS Exception: Cannot read properties of undefined

This repository demonstrates a common React Native error:  "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')". This error typically occurs when you attempt to access a property of an object before that object has been fully initialized or when dealing with asynchronous data fetching.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code that leads to this error.  The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates several approaches to fixing the issue.

Solutions include:

* **Conditional Rendering:** Check if the data is available before trying to render it.
* **Default Values:** Assign default values to properties to avoid undefined errors.
* **Asynchronous Data Handling (Promises/Async/Await):** Ensure data is fetched before using it in the component.
* **Optional Chaining (?.)** Access nested properties safely.
